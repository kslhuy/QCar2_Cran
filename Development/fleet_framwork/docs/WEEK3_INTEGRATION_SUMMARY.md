# Week 3 Integration Summary

**Date:** October 5, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

---

## 🎯 Objective

Integrate trust-based adaptive weight calculation (Week 2) into the distributed observer system (Week 1) for real-time consensus estimation.

---

## 📋 Changes Made

### 1. VehicleObserver.py

#### 1.1 Modified `__init__()` method
**Location:** Lines 22-42

**Added Parameters:**
```python
vehicle_process=None,         # Reference to VehicleProcess for trust access
weight_trust_module=None      # WeightTrustModule instance for adaptive weights
```

**New Instance Variables:**
```python
self.vehicle_process = vehicle_process
self.weight_trust_module = weight_trust_module
self.use_trust_weights = (weight_trust_module is not None and vehicle_process is not None)
```

#### 1.2 Modified `_get_distributed_weights()` method
**Location:** Lines 1297-1390

**Algorithm:**
```python
if self.use_trust_weights:
    # 1. Get trust scores from GraphBasedTrustEvaluator (Week 1)
    trust_scores = trust_evaluator.get_all_trust_scores()
    
    # 2. Call calculate_weights_trust_v2() (Week 2)
    result = self.weight_trust_module.calculate_weights_trust_v2(
        vehicle_index=self.vehicle_id,
        trust_scores=trust_array
    )
    
    # 3. Extract vehicle weights (remove virtual node weight)
    vehicle_weights = result['weights'].flatten()[1:]
    
    # 4. Update weight matrix with adaptive weights
    weights[self.vehicle_id, :] = vehicle_weights
    
else:
    # Fallback: Equal weight distribution (original)
    weights = equal_weights()
```

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Trust scores from Week 1 feed directly into Week 2
- ✅ Virtual node weight (index 0) properly removed
- ✅ Graceful fallback to equal weights if trust unavailable
- ✅ Detailed logging for debugging

### 2. VehicleProcess.py

#### 2.1 Added Import
**Location:** Line 45
```python
from src.Weight.Weight_Trust_module import WeightTrustModule  # Week 3
```

#### 2.2 WeightTrustModule Initialization
**Location:** Lines 545-568

```python
if self.trust_enabled and len(self.connected_vehicles) > 0:
    self.weight_trust_module = WeightTrustModule(
        graph=self.fleet_graph,
        trust_threshold=vehicle_config.get('trust_threshold', 0.5),
        kappa=vehicle_config.get('kappa', 5)
    )
else:
    self.weight_trust_module = None
```

**Timing:** Initialized AFTER trust_evaluator (Week 1) setup

#### 2.3 VehicleObserver Initialization Update
**Location:** Lines 572-593

**Old:**
```python
self.observer = VehicleObserver(
    vehicle_id=self.vehicle_id,
    fleet_size=self.fleet_size,
    config=self.config,
    logger=self.logger,
    initial_pose=initial_pose
)
```

**New (Week 3):**
```python
self.observer = VehicleObserver(
    vehicle_id=self.vehicle_id,
    fleet_size=self.fleet_size,
    config=self.config,
    logger=self.logger,
    initial_pose=initial_pose,
    vehicle_process=self,                      # ← Week 3: Pass self reference
    weight_trust_module=self.weight_trust_module  # ← Week 3: Pass weight module
)
```

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Unit Tests (Week 2 - Already Complete)
- ✅ Row-stochastic property (weights sum to 1)
- ✅ Zero trust → zero weight
- ✅ Trust-proportional distribution

### Integration Tests (Week 3 - To Verify)

#### Test 3.1: Observer Initialization
```python
# Verify observer receives references
assert observer.vehicle_process is not None
assert observer.weight_trust_module is not None
assert observer.use_trust_weights == True
```

#### Test 3.2: Weight Calculation
```python
# Verify adaptive weights are computed
weights = observer._get_distributed_weights()
assert weights.shape == (fleet_size, fleet_size)
assert np.allclose(np.sum(weights[vehicle_id, :]), 1.0)  # Row-stochastic
```

#### Test 3.3: Trust Score Propagation
```python
# Verify trust scores flow from Week 1 to Week 2
trust_scores = trust_evaluator.get_all_trust_scores()
# Weights should reflect trust scores
# Higher trust → higher weight
```

#### Test 3.4: Fallback Behavior
```python
# Disable trust: verify fallback to equal weights
observer.use_trust_weights = False
weights = observer._get_distributed_weights()
# Should return equal weights (original behavior)
```

## 📊 Expected Behavior

### Scenario: 3-Vehicle Platoon (V0 -- V1 -- V2)

**Vehicle 1's Perspective:**

| Neighbor | Trust Score | Default Weight | Adaptive Weight | Change |
|----------|-------------|----------------|-----------------|--------|
| V0       | 0.9         | 0.5            | 0.32            | -36%   |
| V2       | 0.7         | 0.5            | 0.18            | -64%   |
| Self     | N/A         | 0.0            | 0.20            | +20%   |
| Virtual  | N/A         | 0.0            | 0.30            | +30%   |

**Interpretation:**
- V0 (high trust): Gets 32% weight instead of 50% (rebalanced by virtual/self)
- V2 (medium trust): Gets 18% weight instead of 50% (proportionally less)
- Self weight: 20% (fixed, for local estimate confidence)
- Virtual weight: 30% (fixed, for reference trajectory)

**Consensus Impact:**
- Faster convergence (trusted neighbors weighted more)
- Better resilience to attacks (low-trust neighbors have less influence)
- Maintains stability (row-stochastic property preserved)

## 🚀 Running the System

### Configuration (vehicle_config.yaml or similar)

```yaml
trust:
  enabled: true
  trust_threshold: 0.5    # Minimum trust for neighbor inclusion
  kappa: 5                # Maximum neighbors to consider
  trust_update_interval: 0.5  # Trust calculation frequency (seconds)
  trust_buffer_size: 20   # Number of samples to buffer

fleet:
  fleet_size: 3
  fleet_graph:            # Adjacency matrix (3x3)
    - [0, 1, 0]
    - [1, 0, 1]
    - [0, 1, 0]
```

### Execution

```bash
cd Development/fleet_framwork
python main.py
```

### Expected Logs

```
[INFO] Vehicle 1: WeightTrustModule initialized - trust_threshold=0.5, kappa=5
[INFO] [WEEK3] V1: Adaptive weight calculation enabled
[INFO] [WEEK3] V1: Observer initialized with trust-based adaptive weights
[INFO] TRUST_WEIGHTS: V1 using adaptive weights. Trusted neighbors: [0, 2], Virtual weight: 0.300, Self weight: 0.200
```

## 📝 Next Steps

### Week 4: Validation & Tuning (Optional)
1. **Performance Analysis:**
   - Compare consensus convergence time (adaptive vs. equal weights)
   - Measure estimation error under attacks
   - Analyze computational overhead

2. **Parameter Tuning:**
   - Optimal `w0_fixed` (virtual weight)
   - Optimal `w_self_base` (self weight)
   - Optimal `eta` (EMA smoothing factor)

3. **Attack Scenarios:**
   - Position spoofing attack on V0
   - Verify V1 reduces weight to V0 automatically
   - Confirm consensus still converges

### Week 5: Documentation & Deployment
1. Create user guide for trust-based consensus
2. Add visualization tools for weight adaptation
3. Write paper section on adaptive weights

## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

### Issue 1: Single-Vehicle Weight Update
**Current:** Only the host vehicle's row in the weight matrix uses adaptive weights.  
**Impact:** Other vehicles still use equal weights (they don't know our trust scores).  
**Future:** Each vehicle independently calculates its own adaptive weights (already implemented per-vehicle).

### Issue 2: Symmetry Breaking
**Current:** Weight matrix may not be symmetric (W_ij ≠ W_ji).  
**Impact:** Consensus may converge slightly slower than symmetric weights.  
**Mitigation:** EMA smoothing provides temporal stability.

### Issue 3: Bootstrap Period
**Current:** Trust scores are 0.0 initially (no data yet).  
**Impact:** First ~1 second uses equal weights until trust accumulates.  
**Mitigation:** Trust updates every 0.5s, so adaptive weights active quickly.
