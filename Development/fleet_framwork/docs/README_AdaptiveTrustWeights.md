## Key Questions Answered

### "What is the virtual node, really?"
📖 **Read:** `AdaptiveTrustWeight_Clarifications.md` - Section 1.1-1.3  
**Answer:** It's our LOCAL OBSERVER's estimate, NOT raw sensors. Uses received data from target (if connected) or previous estimate (if not).

### "How do I get covariance and innovation?"
📖 **Read:** `AdaptiveTrustWeight_Clarifications.md` - Section 2  
**Answer:** 
- Covariance: Broadcast `trace(observer.P_local)` in state messages
- Innovation: `norm(received_state - predicted_state)` using constant-velocity model

### "Why must weights sum to 1?"
📖 **Read:** `AdaptiveTrustWeight_Proof.md` - Theorem 1  
**Answer:** Row-stochastic property ensures bounded estimation error (Corollary 2) and consensus convergence (Theorem 2).

### "How does hysteresis work?"
📖 **Read:** `AdaptiveTrustWeightDesign.md` - Section 3.1 (Soft Gates)  
**Answer:** State machine with two thresholds (τ_low=0.4, τ_high=0.6) prevents oscillation near single threshold.

### "What if target is not directly connected?"
📖 **Read:** `AdaptiveTrustWeight_Clarifications.md` - Section 1.3  
**Answer:** Set w₀ low (0.1) since we have no direct data from target. Rely on neighbors who ARE connected.

### "What parameters should I use?"
📖 **Read:** `AdaptiveTrustWeight_QuickRef.md` - Section 3 (Configuration presets)  
**Answer:** 
- Safety-critical: Conservative preset (high thresholds, strong local anchor)
- Performance: Aggressive preset (low thresholds, trust fleet more)

### "How do I test this?"
📖 **Read:** `AdaptiveTrustWeight_QuickRef.md` - Section 4 (Testing checklist)  
**Answer:** 
- Unit tests: Row-stochastic, gating, hysteresis
- Integration: 3-vehicle chain, Byzantine attack, GPS denial
- Benchmarks: RMSE, convergence time, weight stability

## Critical Implementation Reminders

### ⚠️ MUST DO:
1. ✅ Check graph connectivity before setting high w₀
2. ✅ Clamp `w_self ≤ 1 - w0` to ensure row-stochastic
3. ✅ Apply hysteresis to prevent oscillation
4. ✅ Normalize neighbor weights: `w_k = neighbor_mass * (s[k] / sum(s))`
5. ✅ Broadcast covariance in state messages

### ⚠️ MUST NOT DO:
1. ❌ Assume virtual node uses camera/LiDAR for distant targets
2. ❌ Skip normalization step
3. ❌ Use hard threshold without hysteresis
4. ❌ Forget to clamp w_self upper bound
5. ❌ Set high w₀ for disconnected targets
