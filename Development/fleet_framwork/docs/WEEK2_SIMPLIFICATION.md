# Week 2 Simplification Summary

**Date:** October 5, 2025  
**Reason:** Trust evaluation (Week 1) already handles quality gating and multi-factor scoring

---

## 🔄 What Changed

### Original Week 2 Plan (Complex)

```python
# STAGE 1: GATING
- Hard gates (message age, innovation threshold)
- Soft gate (hysteresis for trust transitions)

# STAGE 2: MULTI-FACTOR SCORING  
- Trust component (local + global with exponents)
- Freshness component (age decay)
- Reliability component (drop rate)
- Uncertainty component (covariance penalty)
- Geometry component (distance penalty)

# STAGE 3: NORMALIZATION
- Adaptive virtual weight (based on self-covariance)
- Adaptive self weight (based on self-covariance)
- Proportional neighbor distribution
- Influence capping
- EMA smoothing
```

**Issues:**
- ❌ Redundant with trust evaluation
- ❌ Trust already includes age, drop rate, innovation
- ❌ Self-covariance not available yet
- ❌ Hysteresis not needed (trust is smooth)

---

### Simplified Week 2 Plan (Clean)

```python
# Trust scores (0-1) come from Week 1 trust evaluation

# ONLY ADD: Geometry adjustment
- Distance penalty: closer neighbors get more weight

# NORMALIZATION (simplified)
- Fixed virtual weight (w0 = 0.3)
- Fixed self weight (w_self = 0.2)
- Proportional neighbor distribution (remaining 0.5)
- Influence capping (max 40% per neighbor)
- EMA smoothing (temporal stability)
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Clear separation: Trust handles quality, weights handle distribution
- ✅ Simpler: ~100 lines vs ~200 lines
- ✅ Maintainable: Easy to understand and debug
- ✅ Effective: Trust already optimized

## 🎯 Function Signature Comparison

### Original (Complex)
```python
def calculate_weights_trust_v2(
    self,
    vehicle_index: int,
    trust_local: np.ndarray,
    trust_global: np.ndarray,
    message_ages: Optional[np.ndarray] = None,
    drop_rates: Optional[np.ndarray] = None,
    neighbor_covariances: Optional[np.ndarray] = None,
    distances: Optional[np.ndarray] = None,
    self_covariance: Optional[float] = None,
    innovations: Optional[np.ndarray] = None,
    prev_weights: Optional[np.ndarray] = None,
    config: Optional[Dict] = None
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
```

### Simplified (Clean)
```python
def calculate_weights_trust_v2(
    self,
    vehicle_index: int,
    trust_scores: np.ndarray,      # Combined trust (0-1)
    distances: Optional[np.ndarray] = None,
    config: Optional[Dict] = None
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
```

**Reduced from 12 parameters to 4 parameters!**

## 🧪 Testing Updates

### Original Tests
- Row-stochastic property ✅ (kept)
- Hard gate for stale messages ❌ (removed - trust handles)
- Hysteresis transitions ❌ (removed - not needed)

### Simplified Tests
- Row-stochastic property ✅
- Zero trust → zero weight ✅ (new)
- Distance penalty ✅ (new - verify geometry works)

## ✅ Action Items

Week 2 tasks remain the same structure, but with simplified code:

1. ✅ Task 2.1: Add simplified config (8 params instead of 18)
2. ✅ Task 2.2: Add `prev_weights` dict (no hysteresis state machine)
3. ✅ Task 2.3: Implement simplified `calculate_weights_trust_v2()` (~100 lines)
4. ✅ Task 2.4: Create simplified unit tests (3 tests instead of many)
5. ✅ Task 2.5: Verify checklist

**Estimated time saved:** 2-3 days (less code = faster implementation and testing)

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

After Week 2, proceed to **Week 3: Integration**
- Pass trust scores from `GraphBasedTrustEvaluator` to `WeightTrustModule`
- Update `VehicleObserver` to call `calculate_weights_trust_v2()`
- Test end-to-end: trust → weights → consensus
