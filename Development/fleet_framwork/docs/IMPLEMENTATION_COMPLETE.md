**Status:** 🟢 Ready for Testing

---

## 🎯 What We Accomplished

Successfully integrated **communication quality metrics** into the existing **GraphBasedTrust** system!

### Key Changes Summary:

1. ✅ **VehicleProcess.py** - Quality metrics collection and access
2. ✅ **TriPTrustModel.py** - New quality evaluation method
3. ✅ **GraphBasedTrust.py** - Quality factor integration into trust calculation
4. ❌ **Removed** - Unnecessary distance calculation code (fleet topology known)

---

## 📝 Changes Made

### 1. VehicleProcess.py

#### ✅ **Kept from Week 1 (Already working):**
- Covariance broadcasting in `broadcast_own_state()`
- Quality tracking initialization (`neighbor_quality` dict)
- Innovation computation in `_handle_vehicle_state_direct()`
- State prediction for innovation calculation

#### ✅ **Simplified:**
```python
# REMOVED: Complex _get_neighbor_quality_metrics() with distance arrays
# REMOVED: _compute_distance_from_states() - not needed!

# ADDED: Simple per-vehicle quality getter
def get_quality_metrics_for_vehicle(self, vehicle_id: int) -> Optional[Dict]:
    """Get quality metrics for a specific vehicle."""
    # Returns: {age, drop_rate, covariance, innovation}

def _compute_drop_rate(self, vehicle_id: int) -> float:
    """Compute packet drop rate for a vehicle."""
```

#### ✅ **Connected quality to trust:**
```python
# In __init__ after trust_evaluator creation:
if self.trust_evaluator is not None:
    self.trust_evaluator.set_vehicle_process_reference(self)
    self.logger.info(f"Vehicle {self.vehicle_id}: Connected quality metrics to trust evaluator")
```

---

### 2. TriPTrustModel.py

#### ✅ **Added quality evaluation method:**
```python
def evaluate_communication_quality(self, message_age: float, drop_rate: float, 
                                   covariance: float, innovation: float) -> float:
    """
    Evaluate communication quality factor for trust calculation.
    
    Returns:
        Quality factor [0, 1] where 1 = perfect quality
    """
    # Age penalty (exponential decay)
    age_factor = np.exp(-2.0 * message_age)
    
    # Drop rate penalty (linear)
    reliability_factor = 1.0 - drop_rate
    
    # Covariance penalty (inverse relationship)
    uncertainty_factor = 1.0 / (1.0 + 0.2 * covariance)
    
    # Innovation penalty (prediction accuracy)
    consistency_factor = np.exp(-0.5 * innovation)
    
    # Combine all factors (multiplicative)
    quality_factor = age_factor * reliability_factor * uncertainty_factor * consistency_factor
    
    return quality_factor
```

#### ✅ **Added logging arrays:**
```python
# In __init__:
self.age_factor_log = []
self.reliability_factor_log = []
self.uncertainty_factor_log = []
self.consistency_factor_log = []
self.quality_factor_log = []
```

---

### 3. GraphBasedTrust.py

#### ✅ **Added quality metrics access:**
```python
def set_vehicle_process_reference(self, vehicle_process):
    """Set reference to VehicleProcess for accessing quality metrics."""
    self.vehicle_process = vehicle_process

def _get_quality_metrics_for_vehicle(self, target_id: int) -> Optional[Dict]:
    """Get quality metrics from VehicleProcess."""
    if self.vehicle_process is None:
        return None
    return self.vehicle_process.get_quality_metrics_for_vehicle(target_id)
```

#### ✅ **Enhanced local trust calculation:**
```python
# In _evaluate_local_trust():

# Calculate base trust sample (from velocity, distance, etc.)
trust_sample = trust_model.calculate_trust_sample(
    v_score=v_score,
    d_score=d_score,
    a_score=a_score,
    beacon_score=beacon_score,
    h_score=h_score,
    is_nearby=is_nearby
)

# NEW: Get quality metrics and apply quality factor
quality_metrics = self._get_quality_metrics_for_vehicle(target_id)

if quality_metrics is not None:
    # Evaluate communication quality factor
    quality_factor = trust_model.evaluate_communication_quality(
        message_age=quality_metrics.get('age', 0.0),
        drop_rate=quality_metrics.get('drop_rate', 0.0),
        covariance=quality_metrics.get('covariance', 1.0),
        innovation=quality_metrics.get('innovation', 0.0)
    )
    
    # Apply quality factor to trust sample
    trust_sample = trust_sample * quality_factor
    
    logger.debug(f"QUALITY_FACTOR: V{target_id} = {quality_factor:.3f} "
               f"(age={quality_metrics['age']:.2f}s, drop={quality_metrics['drop_rate']:.2f}, "
               f"cov={quality_metrics['covariance']:.3f}, innov={quality_metrics['innovation']:.3f}m)")
```

## 🔄 How It Works Now

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    Message Flow                             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

1. Vehicle receives message
   ↓
   VehicleProcess._handle_vehicle_state_direct()
   ├─ Update neighbor_quality:
   │  ├─ last_recv_time (for age)
   │  ├─ recv_count (for drop_rate)
   │  ├─ last_covariance (from message)
   │  └─ recent_innovations (computed via prediction)
   └─ Buffer state → trust_evaluator.buffer_local_state()

2. Periodic trust update (every 0.5s)
   ↓
   trust_evaluator.update_all_trust_scores()
   ├─ For each vehicle:
   │  └─ _evaluate_local_trust()
   │      ├─ Calculate v_score, d_score (existing TriPTrust)
   │      ├─ Calculate base trust_sample
   │      ├─ NEW: Get quality_metrics from VehicleProcess
   │      ├─ NEW: Calculate quality_factor
   │      ├─ NEW: trust_sample = trust_sample × quality_factor
   │      └─ Return enhanced local_trust_score
   └─ Store trust scores

3. Observer uses trust
   ↓
   VehicleObserver._get_distributed_weights()
   └─ Get trust scores (already includes quality!)
```

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### ✅ Step 1: Check Logs for Quality Metrics
```bash
python main.py
```

**Look for these log messages:**

1. **Initialization:**
   ```
   Vehicle X: Initialized quality tracking for Y neighbors
   Vehicle X: Connected quality metrics to trust evaluator
   ```

2. **Quality Factor Logs (every 0.5s):**
   ```
   QUALITY_FACTOR: V1 = 0.850 (age=0.10s, drop=0.00, cov=0.450, innov=0.15m)
   LOCAL_TRUST: V1 -> 0.920 (v=0.980, d=0.990, q=0.850, dist=8.2m [sensor])
   ```

### ✅ Step 2: Verify Quality Metrics Capture

**Check that these values are reasonable:**
- **age**: Should be < 0.5s normally (message freshness)
- **drop_rate**: Should be 0.0 - 0.1 normally (< 10% packet loss)
- **covariance**: Should be 0.1 - 1.0 (uncertainty from Kalman filter)
- **innovation**: Should be < 1.0m normally (prediction accuracy)

### ✅ Step 3: Test Quality Factor Impact

**Simulate degraded conditions:**

1. **Test high packet loss:**
   - Disconnect one vehicle briefly
   - Check drop_rate increases → quality_factor decreases → trust decreases

2. **Test stale messages:**
   - Delay communication
   - Check age increases → quality_factor decreases

3. **Test high uncertainty:**
   - Vehicle with poor GPS/sensors
   - Check covariance increases → quality_factor decreases

4. **Test prediction error:**
   - Vehicle makes sudden maneuver
   - Check innovation spikes → quality_factor decreases temporarily

---

## 📊 Expected Behavior

### Normal Operation:
```
quality_factor ≈ 0.8 - 1.0
trust_score ≈ 0.9 - 1.0
```

### Degraded Communication:
```
High packet loss (drop_rate=0.5):
  quality_factor ≈ 0.5
  trust_score reduced by 50%

Stale messages (age=1.0s):
  quality_factor ≈ 0.14 (exp(-2.0))
  trust_score heavily reduced
```

### Under Attack:
```
Malicious data (high innovation):
  innovation = 5.0m
  consistency_factor = 0.082
  quality_factor ≈ 0.08
  trust_score << 0.1 (severely reduced)
```

✅ **Comprehensive quality assessment**
- Age (freshness)
- Drop rate (reliability)
- Covariance (uncertainty)
- Innovation (consistency)

✅ **Multiplicative quality factor**
- Any bad metric reduces trust
- Combined effect of all quality issues
- Natural 0-1 normalization

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Run simulation** and check logs
2. **Verify quality metrics** are computed correctly
3. **Test with packet loss** scenario
4. **Tune parameters** if needed:
   - Age decay rate (currently 2.0)
   - Covariance penalty weight (currently 0.2)
   - Innovation sensitivity (currently 0.5)

---

## 🔧 Parameter Tuning Guide

If you need to adjust sensitivity:

### In TriPTrustModel.evaluate_communication_quality():

```python
# More aggressive age penalty (messages expire faster):
age_factor = np.exp(-3.0 * message_age)  # Change from 2.0 to 3.0

# More sensitive to packet loss:
reliability_factor = (1.0 - drop_rate) ** 2  # Square the factor

# More/less sensitive to covariance:
uncertainty_factor = 1.0 / (1.0 + 0.5 * covariance)  # Change 0.2 to 0.5

# More/less sensitive to innovation:
consistency_factor = np.exp(-1.0 * innovation)  # Change 0.5 to 1.0
```
