# Gamma Local Implementation Update

**Date**: October 3, 2025  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Implemented  
**Version**: 2.2 (Neighbor Consistency Check)

---

## üéØ Problem Statement

The previous `_compute_gamma_local` implementation compared fleet estimates globally across all vehicles. However, the correct approach (from `TriPTrustModel.compute_local_consistency_factor`) is:

**"Check if the internal consistency of received fleet estimates matches our actual measured relative distances for direct neighbors"**

---

## ‚úÖ New Implementation Logic

### Core Concept

For **direct neighbors only** (predecessor/successor):
1. **Get received fleet estimates** from target vehicle (their view of all vehicles)
2. **Extract internal position differences** in their fleet estimates
3. **Compare with our actual measurements** of relative distance
4. **Calculate consistency error** between their internal estimates and our measurements

### Example Scenario

```
Fleet: V0 (leader) ‚Üí V1 (us) ‚Üí V2 (follower)

Received from V0's fleet estimates:
- V0's position: [10.0, 0.0]
- V1's position: [5.0, 0.0]  ‚Üê What V0 thinks about US
- V2's position: [0.0, 0.0]

Our actual measurements:
- V0 is 4.8m ahead of us (from sensors/observer)
- V2 is 5.2m behind us

Internal consistency check:
- V0's estimate: |10.0 - 5.0| - 2.0 = 3.0m (their internal distance)
- Our measurement: 4.8m
- ERROR: |3.0 - 4.8| = 1.8m ‚ùå

If error is large ‚Üí gamma_local is LOW ‚Üí untrusted
If error is small ‚Üí gamma_local is HIGH ‚Üí trusted
```

## üîß Implementation Details

### Key Changes in `_compute_gamma_local()`

#### 1. **Extract Our Vehicle from Target's Estimate**
```python
# Get target's estimate of OUR vehicle
our_id_str = str(self.vehicle_id)
target_estimate_of_us = target_fleet_estimates[our_id_str]
x_l_i_pos = target_estimate_of_us.get('pos', [0, 0])  # Target's estimate of our position
x_l_i_vel = target_estimate_of_us.get('vel', 0.0)
```

#### 2. **Check Predecessor (Vehicle Ahead)**
```python
predecessor_id = self.vehicle_id - 1

# Get target's estimate of predecessor
x_l_pred_pos = target_fleet_estimates[pred_id_str].get('pos', [0, 0])
x_l_pred_vel = target_fleet_estimates[pred_id_str].get('vel', 0.0)

# Our actual measured relative distance
host_distance_measurement = abs(our_pred_pos[0] - our_pos[0]) - half_length_vehicle
velocity_diff_measurement = abs(our_pred_vel - our_vel)

# Target's internal estimate (difference between pred and us)
rel_pos_est = abs(x_l_pred_pos[0] - x_l_i_pos[0]) - half_length_vehicle
rel_vel_est = abs(x_l_pred_vel - x_l_i_vel)

# Consistency error
e = [rel_pos_est - host_distance_measurement, 
     rel_vel_est - velocity_diff_measurement]
```

#### 3. **Check Successor (Vehicle Behind)**
```python
successor_id = self.vehicle_id + 1

# Similar logic but reversed direction
host_distance_measurement = abs(our_pos[0] - our_succ_pos[0]) - half_length_vehicle
rel_pos_est = abs(x_l_i_pos[0] - x_l_succ_pos[0]) - half_length_vehicle

# Consistency error
e = [rel_pos_est - host_distance_measurement, ...]
```

#### 4. **Weighted Error Calculation**
```python
# Using tau2 covariance matrix: diag([1.5, 0.5])
E_pos = (e[0] / 1.5) ** 2  # Position error (tau2 = 1.5)
E_vel = (e[1] / 0.5) ** 2  # Velocity error (tau2 = 0.5)
E += E_pos + E_vel
```

#### 5. **Compute Gamma Local**
```python
gamma_local = exp(-E)
```

## üìä Comparison: Old vs New

### ‚ùå Old Implementation
```python
# Compared ALL vehicles in fleet
for veh_id_str, target_estimate in target_fleet_estimates.items():
    if veh_id == self.vehicle_id or veh_id == target_id:
        continue  # Skip self and target
    
    # Get OUR distributed observer's estimate
    our_estimate = our_fleet_estimates[veh_id]
    
    # Direct comparison (not checking internal consistency)
    pos_error = sqrt((target_pos - our_pos)^2)
    vel_error = |target_vel - our_vel|
```

**Problems**:
- Compares global estimates (not internal consistency)
- Doesn't use actual measured relative distances
- Checks all vehicles (not just direct neighbors)

### ‚úÖ New Implementation
```python
# Check ONLY direct neighbors (predecessor/successor)
predecessor_id = self.vehicle_id - 1
successor_id = self.vehicle_id + 1

# For each neighbor:
# 1. Get target's internal estimate (difference in their fleet estimate)
rel_pos_est = |target_est[pred] - target_est[us]| - vehicle_length

# 2. Get our actual measurement
host_distance_measurement = |our_obs[pred] - our_obs[us]| - vehicle_length

# 3. Compare internal consistency
e = rel_pos_est - host_distance_measurement
E += (e / tau2)^2
```

**Advantages**:
- ‚úÖ Checks internal consistency (what they claim vs what we measure)
- ‚úÖ Uses actual relative distance measurements
- ‚úÖ Focuses on direct neighbors (where we have reliable measurements)
- ‚úÖ Matches TriPTrustModel.compute_local_consistency_factor logic

## üéØ Attack Detection Example

### Scenario: False Distance Injection

```
Normal Case:
-----------
V0's fleet estimate: V0=[10.0], V1=[5.0], V2=[0.0]
Our measurement: V0 is 5.0m ahead
Internal: |10.0 - 5.0| - 2.0 = 3.0m
Measured: 5.0m
Error: 2.0m ‚Üí gamma_local ‚âà 0.22 (questionable but ok)

Attack Case:
-----------
V0's fleet estimate (MALICIOUS): V0=[10.0], V1=[2.0], V2=[0.0]
  ‚Üë V0 is lying about our position!
Our measurement: V0 is 5.0m ahead (actual)
Internal: |10.0 - 2.0| - 2.0 = 6.0m
Measured: 5.0m
Error: 1.0m ‚Üí gamma_local ‚âà 0.37 (suspicious)

Combined with gamma_cross:
- gamma_cross will ALSO be low (position mismatch)
- global_trust = gamma_cross √ó gamma_local ‚âà 0.15 √ó 0.37 = 0.055
- ‚ùå ATTACK DETECTED (trust < 0.2)
```

## üìã Key Parameters

| Parameter | Value | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| `half_length_vehicle` | 2.0 m | Half of vehicle length (for spacing calculations) |
| `tau2_pos` | 1.5 | Sensitivity for position consistency (meters¬≤) |
| `tau2_vel` | 0.5 | Sensitivity for velocity consistency (m/s)¬≤ |
| `predecessor_id` | `vehicle_id - 1` | Direct vehicle ahead |
| `successor_id` | `vehicle_id + 1` | Direct vehicle behind |

---

## üî¨ Mathematical Formulation

### Consistency Error Calculation

For predecessor (vehicle ahead):
```
y_i_predecessor = [d_measured_pos, d_measured_vel]
  where:
    d_measured_pos = |pos_pred - pos_us|_measured - L/2
    d_measured_vel = |vel_pred - vel_us|_measured

rel_state_est = [d_estimate_pos, d_estimate_vel]
  where:
    d_estimate_pos = |pos_pred - pos_us|_from_fleet_estimate - L/2
    d_estimate_vel = |vel_pred - vel_us|_from_fleet_estimate

e = rel_state_est - y_i_predecessor

E_pos = (e[0] / tau2_pos)^2
E_vel = (e[1] / tau2_vel)^2
E_predecessor = E_pos + E_vel
```

Similar calculation for successor.

### Final Trust Factor
```
E_total = E_predecessor + E_successor
gamma_local = exp(-E_total)
```

## üß™ Testing Scenarios

### Test 1: Normal Operation
```python
# Expected: gamma_local > 0.8
Fleet estimates internally consistent
Relative distances match measurements
Result: ‚úÖ High trust
```

### Test 2: Position Spoofing
```python
# Expected: gamma_local < 0.3
Target reports wrong position in fleet estimate
Internal consistency violated
Result: ‚úÖ Attack detected
```

### Test 3: Velocity Mismatch
```python
# Expected: gamma_local ‚âà 0.5-0.7
Target reports slightly wrong velocities
Position ok but velocity inconsistent
Result: ‚úÖ Partial trust reduction
```

### Test 4: No Direct Neighbors
```python
# Expected: gamma_local = 1.0 (neutral)
Vehicle has no predecessor/successor
Cannot check consistency
Result: ‚úÖ Default to neutral trust
```

## üìù Integration Notes

### VehicleProcess Changes
No changes needed! The function is called with the same signature:
```python
gamma_local = self._compute_gamma_local(
    target_id, 
    target_fleet_estimates,  # Received fleet estimates
    our_local_state,         # Our local observer state
    our_fleet_estimates,     # Our distributed observer estimates
    logger
)
```

### Data Requirements
Ensure the following data is available:
- ‚úÖ `our_fleet_estimates[predecessor_id]` - Our estimate of predecessor
- ‚úÖ `our_fleet_estimates[successor_id]` - Our estimate of successor
- ‚úÖ `target_fleet_estimates[our_id]` - Target's estimate of us
- ‚úÖ `target_fleet_estimates[predecessor_id]` - Target's estimate of predecessor
- ‚úÖ `target_fleet_estimates[successor_id]` - Target's estimate of successor

---

## üéì Key Takeaways

### Why This Approach Works

1. **Direct Measurements are Reliable**
   - We have sensors (Lidar/Camera) for direct neighbors
   - More accurate than estimated positions for distant vehicles

2. **Internal Consistency Reveals Attacks**
   - If a vehicle lies about positions, their internal fleet estimate won't match our measurements
   - Hard for attacker to maintain consistency across all vehicles

3. **Focuses on Relevant Data**
   - Only checks neighbors we can actually measure
   - Ignores distant vehicles where measurements are unreliable

4. **Matches Proven Theory**
   - Follows TriPTrustModel.compute_local_consistency_factor()
   - Based on published research methodology
