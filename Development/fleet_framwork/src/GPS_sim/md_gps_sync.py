    """
    GPS-like time synchronization client for vehicle fleet coordination.
    
    This class acts as a GPS time synchronization client that connects to a central
    GPS time server to maintain synchronized time across multiple vehicles in a fleet.
    It provides functionality to request time from a GPS server, calculate time offsets,
    and provide synchronized timestamps for coordination purposes.
    
    Key Features:
    - UDP-based communication with GPS time server
    - Automatic time offset calculation and management
    - Fault tolerance with fallback to last known offset
    - Simulated GPS jitter for realistic behavior
    - Periodic synchronization capability
    
    Attributes:
        gps_time_offset (float): Current time offset between GPS and local time
        last_sync_time (float): Timestamp of last successful synchronization
        gps_server_ip (str): IP address of the GPS time server
        gps_server_port (int): Port number of the GPS time server
        last_valid_offset (float): Last known valid time offset for fallback

        Establishes a UDP connection to the GPS time server and requests the current
